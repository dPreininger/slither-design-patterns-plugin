# Helper scritps

This scripts are used to analyze a large number of files. The fine-grained output is lost, so it is only useful for a quick overview and statistical analysis.

## How to use

Only tested to work inside Bash shell on Linux.

- Open a terminal
- Navigate to this directory
- Run `source init.sh` to make the analyze file executable and to add it to path temporarily
- Run `analyze <path-to-directory-for-analysis> <path-to-directory-containing-dependencies>`
